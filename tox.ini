# Tox is the QA gateway before releasing
# it can run against multiple python versions
# it runs commands in virtualenvs prepared with python version and dependencies from setup.[py,cfg]
# While tox can be configured to do plenty of things, it is bothersome to work with quickly, and it is not a lightweight dependency, so prefer to write build logic in setup.py or other commands that run without tox.
